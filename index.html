  <h1>History and Modern Trends in Version Control Systems</h1>

  <p>
    Version control has evolved from early local and centralized tools 
    (SCCS, RCS, CVS, Subversion) to distributed systems like Git and Mercurial.
    Today, cloud platforms, workflows, and automation define the modern VCS ecosystem.
  </p>

  <h2>Why Distributed VCS Changed the Game</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Every developer has a full copy of the repository — enabling offline work and faster local operations.</li>
    <li>Branching and merging became easy and safe, allowing teams to experiment and innovate more freely.</li>
    <li>Speed and flexibility: commits, diffs, and logs are local, not dependent on a central server.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Distributed systems such as Git transformed collaboration by decentralizing control.
    They reduced dependency on single servers, encouraged community-driven development,
    and introduced workflows that later became the standard across the software industry.
