  <h1>Modern Practices and Trends</h1>

  <h2>GitOps</h2>
  <p>
    Git serves as the single source of truth for both code and infrastructure.
    Changes made through commits and merges automatically trigger updates in deployment environments.
    This approach brings software engineering discipline into operations, improving consistency and reliability.
  </p>

  <h2>Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Automatic testing and building after each commit or pull request.</li>
    <li>Automated deployment pipelines — rollbacks are simple via Git revert.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    CI/CD reduces human error, speeds up delivery cycles, and allows teams to release new features confidently and frequently.
  </p>

  <h2>Cloud Platforms</h2>
  <p>
    GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket host repositories, manage pull requests, track issues,
    and integrate CI/CD tools directly into the platform.
    They also enable team visibility, open-source collaboration, and easy scaling for projects of any size.
  </p>

  <h2>AI and Automation</h2>
  <p>
    Artificial intelligence supports code review, suggests improvements, and automates repetitive tasks.
    Emerging tools can detect bugs, generate documentation, or even propose code refactors, making development more efficient.
